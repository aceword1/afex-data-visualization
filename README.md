I believe that i am the APM that DRO Health needs. 


I am a very creative person, I tend to come up with many ideas, and when I get these Ideas, I am very excited and I love to share them with my bosses, my co-workers. 

However, what I realized over the years is that sometimes these ideas are good and sometimes they are not so good i.e. from the eye of the customer. Something I know I need to improve on is how to prioritize some of these ideas and filter them. 

Recently, when I began to study more deliberately on product management, I have been reading a book called “Product Mindset – How to Get Inside your Customer’s Mind” by Product School and it is helping me filter, prioritize and validate my hypotheses. In fact, I have a new startup that I am trying to nurture based on this learning process and would love to tell you more about it. Of course, I am always open to coaching, that can help me to channel my creativity into higher productions for DRO Health.
